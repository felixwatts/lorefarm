This is a demonstration Google App Engine application built using Go, OAUTH2, Datastore, Could Storage and HTML

It is a kind of forum in which anyone can post a reply to any existing post but unlike a forum, one cannot create a new thread. Therefore the posts form a single tree structure with a single root post.

Despite its simplicity, this structure actually supports a range of use cases, such as

- A forum
- A book with chapters and pages
- A story with multiple endings
- A 'choose your own adventure' story
- Meme evolution
